          <p>
            On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks chief executive and
            chairman, held a conference call with reporters to discuss how the
            social network manages problematic posts and its community
            standards. The call quickly went sideways. For more than an hour,
            the 34-year-old billionaire instead fielded questions about how he
            and his No. 2, Sheryl Sandberg, obfuscated problems such as Russian
            interference on Facebook and how the company had gone on the attack
            against rivals and critics. In response, Mr. Zuckerberg — at times
            defiant and at times conciliatory — defended the social network, Ms.
            Sandberg and his own record. The reality of running a company of
            more than 10,000 people is that you are not going to know everything
            thats going on, he said at one point.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet even as Mr. Zuckerberg was making his case, a furor against his
            company was gathering momentum. In Washington, Republicans and
            Democrats threatened to restrain Facebook through competition laws
            and to open investigations into possible campaign finance
            violations. Shareholders ramped up calls to oust Mr. Zuckerberg as
            Facebooks chairman. And activists filed a complaint to the Federal
            Trade Commission about the social networks privacy policies and
            condemned Ms. Sandberg, the chief operating officer, for overseeing
            a campaign to secretly attack opponents. The outcry followed a New
            York Times article that raised questions on Wednesday about
            Facebooks tactics in dealing with disinformation and other problems
            on its site, as well as the way it treats competitors and opponents.
            Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself, said Representative
            David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House
            antitrust subcommittee.
          </p>

          <p>
            This staggering report makes clear that Facebook executives will
            always put their massive profits ahead of the interests of their
            customers. The social media giant has faced a succession of crises
            since 2016, when it was accused of influencing the outcome of the
            American presidential election in favor of Donald J. Trump. Facebook
            has since acknowledged that its platform was a critical conduit for
            Russian interference in the 2016 campaign, and it has grappled with
            leaks of customer data to a British political consulting firm,
            Cambridge Analytica. But while previous scrutiny of Facebook largely
            focused on its business model and how its platform promotes viral
            posts and ads, the latest fallout was directed specifically at Mr.
            Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. The Times article on Wednesday
            described how Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg passed off many
            critical security and policy decisions in recent years and delayed
            responses to abuse on Facebook or played down its significance. More
            recently, Facebook went on the attack, employing other companies to
            divert attention to critics and competitors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In one case, an opposition research firm, Definers Public Affairs,
            worked to discredit protesters by trying to link them to George
            Soros, the liberal financier. That has raised questions about the
            accountability of Mr. Zuckerberg and Ms. Sandberg. Mr. Zuckerberg
            exercises near total control of the social network because he owns
            60 percent of its voting shares and is the head of the board. Ms.
            Sandberg is his handpicked No. 2.
          </p>

          <p>
            On Thursday, Facebooks board said it supported Mr. Zuckerberg and
            Ms. Sandberg. While the board acknowledged that the two executives
            responded slowly to Russian interference on Facebook and that
            directors had pushed them to act faster, it said in a statement that
            to suggest they knew about Russian interference and either tried to
            ignore it or prevent investigations into what had happened was
            grossly unfair. In his conference call, Mr. Zuckerberg echoed
            similar sentiments. To suggest that we were not interested in
            knowing the truth, or to hide what we knew, is simply untrue, he
            said. We are in a much stronger place today than we were in 2016.
            Still, he acknowledged missteps, including the use of Definers
            Public Affairs. Mr. Zuckerberg said he terminated Facebooks
            relationship with Definers late on Wednesday after he learned about
            some of the opposition research firm’s tactics. In general, we need
            to go through all of our relationships and evaluate what might be
            more typical D.C. relationships and decide if we want to continue
            with them, Mr. Zuckerberg said. He declined to answer questions
            about personnel changes, but said Ms. Sandberg was doing great work
            for the company. In a statement on Facebook late Thursday, Ms.
            Sandberg said allegations that she stood in the way of fixing the
            platforms problems are also just plain wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            She also distanced herself from Definers and expressed support for
            Mr. Soros. I did not know we hired them or about the work they were
            doing, but I should have, Ms. Sandberg wrote. I have great respect
            for George Soros — and the anti-Semitic conspiracy theories against
            him are abhorrent. Shareholders said they were concerned about Mr.
            Zuckerbergs concentration of power at Facebook. Last month, several
            shareholders filed a joint resolution to remove him as board
            chairman. On Thursday, one of those shareholders, Scott M. Stringer,
            the comptroller of New York City, who administers the citys public
            pension fund, said Mr. Zuckerbergs grip over Facebook protected him
            from being answerable for the company’s mistakes. Renegade
            executives who are focused only on growth regardless of the risks —
            and withhold information from the board — put their company,
            shareholders and, in Facebooks case, our democracy in jeopardy, Mr.
            Stringer said. The New York City pension fund owns 4.5 million
            shares of Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg said on the conference call that
            he was not willing to step down as chairman.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don’t particularly think that that specific proposal is the right
            way to go, he said. But I am quite focused on ways to get more
            independence around our systems in different ways. Mr. Zuckerberg
            may have other trouble on his hands. Facebook, which has grown
            tremendously as a business in recent years, is dealing with a
            slowdown. And advertisers, the lifeblood of the company’s $40
            billion business, are increasingly criticizing its tactics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up to now, whatever you said about Facebook, you could not say it
            was a two-faced company, said Rishad Tobaccowala, chief growth
            officer for the Publicis Groupe, one of the worlds biggest
            advertising groups. But now it is clear that it says one thing to
            you and does something completely different, Mr. Tobaccowala said.
            This is very hard if you are a marketer. In Washington, Republicans
            and Democrats alike blasted Facebook. Senator Rand Paul, Republican
            from Kentucky, said in an interview on CNN that he was concerned
            over Facebooks power as a monopoly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat from Minnesota, said at a hearing on
            Capitol Hill that she planned to ask the Justice Department to
            investigate whether Facebooks hiring of opposition research firms to
            influence politicians violated campaign finance rules. A coalition
            called Freedom From Facebook, which represents public interest
            groups like Demand Progress and Public Citizen, also filed a
            complaint on Thursday with the Federal Trade Commission to
            investigate Facebook’s violations of users privacy. And Color of
            Change, a civil-rights group that has been critical of the company,
            blasted it for hiring Definers to discredit the group. Facebook is
            violating its most fundamental mission of building human connection,
            as well as the trust placed in it by billions of people, by
            advancing extremist far-right conspiracy theories that are aimed at
            denigrating Jews and belittling people of color, said Rashad
            Robinson, president of Color of Change. Lawmakers from five
            countries — Britain, Canada, Argentina, Ireland and Australia —
            called on Mr. Zuckerberg to testify at a session of what they are
            calling a grand committee in London on Nov. 27. Mr. Zuckerberg
            previously turned down the invitation. Damian Collins, the British
            lawmaker leading the effort, said in an interview on Thursday that
            The Times article appeared to contradict Mr. Zuckerbergs previous
            statements to regulators about his knowledge of Russias interference
            on the site. People at the top of the company were aware of what the
            Russians were doing and sought to keep it to themselves for
            commercial reasons, and thats a betrayal of trust, Mr. Collins said.
            They now need to fully account for what they knew about Russian
            activity on Facebook, when they knew it and why they did not report
            it to authorities much sooner.
